                                    In collaboration with NASA and Arizona State University, this project reimagines how audiences experience space exploration. Visitors interact with a 3D model of the Psyche asteroid, scan QR codes for interactive content, and step into the role of Annibale de Gasparis to rediscover Psyche using a period-accurate telescope. Mythological storytelling enriches the experience, drawing parallels between Psyche’s origins and symbolic imagery of transformation and the soul.

                                    This project re-engineers a standard consumer AC remote into a connected IoT device, enabling centralized smart climate management. A custom base station integrates real-time API data on outside temperature and dew point with zone-specific controls and historical user preferences. By tracking usage patterns, the system learns preferred comfort levels and automatically adjusts cooling profiles to balance comfort with sustainability.

The IoT-enabled controller communicates directly with the AC unit, translating predictive insights into real-world adjustments. This results in a seamless, user-friendly system that modernizes traditional appliances into smart, sustainable devices.
